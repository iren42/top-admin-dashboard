[flex-basis 0 vs 0%](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-basis)
For a flex item with *flex-basis: 0*, the flex item has an initial main size of zero, and it grows to his *min-height* limit. 
For a flex item with *flex-basis: 0%*, the flex item has an initial main size of =300px= because, as the flex container doesn't have a set height, the percentage flex-basis values resolve to the content value (the children of the flex item).
